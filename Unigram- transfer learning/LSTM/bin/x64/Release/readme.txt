# Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Chinese Word Segmentation with a Novel Neural Network

Runing our code is simple!!!
Requirements
#### General
- C#
Example: PKU.

## Test
Run ~\LSTM\bin\x64\Release\LSTM.exe and choose the mode of "testing". 
##  Train
Run ~\LSTM\bin\x64\Release\LSTM.exe and choose the mode of "training".
The code will read the saved model. Please use the saved model trained on MSR dataset. 


The standard F-score evaluation script is included in our code. If you want to use evaluation scripts offerd by datasets, just run our "post-processing.java" code and input "answer.txt" which a testing mode produces.

If you have some problems, send an email to "jingjingxu@pku.edu.cn".
