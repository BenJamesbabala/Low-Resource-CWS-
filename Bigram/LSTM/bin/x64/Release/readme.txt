# Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Chinese Word Segmentation with a Novel Neural Network


Runing our code is simple!!!
Requirements
#### General
- C#
Example: MSR dataset.
## 1. training
run ~\LSTM\bin\x64\Release\LSTM.exe and input "1 2 1". 

## 2. testing
Make sure reading the saved model. 
run ~\LSTM\bin\x64\Release\LSTM.exe and input "2 1 1". 

The standard F-score evaluation script is included in our code, if you want test it with evaluation scripts offerd by datasets, just run our "post-processing.java" code and input "answer.txt" which testing script produces. 

If you have some problems, just send an email to "jingjingxu@pku.edu.cn".
